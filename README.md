This system promotes collaboration, learning, and mutual support among the AASTU community.

## 🧑‍💻 Team Collaboration Instructions 

👋 **Hello Team!** Here's how we're working on the TimeBank project:

---

### 🔁 General Workflow
- All code is organized in the `TimeBank/` folder.
- We use **GitHub branches** per feature (`feature/login-page`, `feature/booking-api`).
- Follow the instructions in each folder’s `README.md` to set up your environment.

---

### 🖥️ Frontend Developers

📁 Go to the `frontend/` folder  
📄 Check the `frontend/README.md` for:

- How to install React dependencies  
- How to run the frontend dev server  
- How to connect to the backend API  
- File structure explained (components, pages, context, etc.)

**Tech stack:**

- React  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Axios (for calling backend)  
- Vite (for faster dev environment)

---

### 🛠️ Backend Developers

📁 Go to the `backend/` folder  
📄 Check the `backend/README.md` for:

- Creating a virtual environment  
- Running migrations  
- Launching the development server  
- How APIs are structured and tested  

**Tech stack:**

- Django  
- Django REST Framework  
- PostgreSQL (or SQLite for local testing)  
- Django Channels (optional for real-time)

---

### ✅ Ground Rules

- Push small commits often with clear messages.  
- Pull latest changes before starting new work.  
- Keep API contracts consistent (backend and frontend teams should sync!).
